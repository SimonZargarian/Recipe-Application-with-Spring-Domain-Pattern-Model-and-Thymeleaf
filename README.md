# Recipe Teaching Spring Domain Pattern Model 

A Java, Spring, Thymeleaf based project with extensive commentary with the purpose of teaching junior developers.

## Description

Recipe Teaching Spring Domain Pattern Model is a Java and Spring-based educational tool designed specifically for teaching junior developers about the implementation of the domain model pattern in web applications. Using Thymeleaf for the view layer, this project serves as both a practical guide and a template for building scalable, maintainable web applications while fostering a deeper understanding of Spring Framework best practices.

### Key Features:
* Educational Focus: Contains extensive comments and documentation designed to guide junior developers through the codebase, explaining core concepts and design choices.
* Domain Model Pattern: Demonstrates the use of the domain model pattern within the Spring ecosystem, emphasizing its benefits in separating business logic from the presentation layer.
* Interactive Learning: Includes interactive elements and tasks for learners to modify and expand upon, promoting hands-on learning.
* Full Application Stack: Integrates Spring Boot for the backend, Thymeleaf for the frontend, and Spring Data JPA for database interactions, providing a comprehensive view of full-stack development.
* Real-World Application: Features a real-world scenario of a recipe management system, making the learning process more engaging and practical.

This project is ideal for developers beginning their journey in Java web development, offering a structured learning pathway through detailed code explanations and the implementation of best practices.
